Now that all TODOs and placeholders are resolved, your task is to **validate and finalize the app** for production use.

Please do the following:

---

### âœ… 1. Validate Feature Completeness
- Confirm that BLE scan, connect, control, and session logging works with up to 9 devices.
- Ensure `Start`, `Pause`, `Stop`, `Intensity`, and `Duration` controls are wired to real logic.
- Verify session management per device is complete.

---

### ðŸ§ª 2. Test Coverage & Self-Healing
- Run all tests in `/test` and `/integration_test`.
- If any fail, **auto-fix the code or the tests**.
- If any critical areas lack tests (e.g., BLE connect, session logging, scheduling), **generate stubs** with 95â€“100% logic coverage.

---

### ðŸš€ 3. Optimize Performance
- Audit all large widgets (>500 lines) and split as needed.
- Convert any blocking/synchronous disk/DB calls to `async` or `compute`.
- Wrap expensive UI regions in `RepaintBoundary` if helpful.
- Apply `const` constructors where possible.

---

### ðŸ§° 4. Build & Analyze
Run the following:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter build apk --debug
